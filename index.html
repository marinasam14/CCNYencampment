	<h1>City College and Columbia University Were Raided the Same Night. Why Did We Only Hear About Columbia?</h1>
	<h2>While the Ivy League campus drew media attention, the NYPD carried out brutal mass arrests at the public university just 20 blocks north.</h2>

			From the evening of April 30th to the early hours of May 1st, the CUNY Gaza Solidarity Encampment reached a dramatic conclusion when the university administration authorized the NYPD to enter the City College of New York campus and sweep the encampment, arresting nearly 200 people, hours after they raided Columbia University in the same militaristic fashion.

		<br><br/>
		<p>
			In the midst of the chaos, reporters raced to break the news of the concurrent raids on the two Harlem campuses, with Columbia University’s receiving a considerable amount of media attention compared to City College’s, although the latter resulted in more arrests. 
		<br><br/>
			The public institution with a 75% student of color population, saw 173 people arrested between the 30th and the 1st. As the trial is set to begin next year for 8 demonstrators who rejected plea deals in favor of having their time in court, it is important to revisit how the disparate coverage helped conceal the City College protester's treatment by the NYPD and the Manhattan DA's office.
		</p>
		<br><br/>
		<p>
			When reviewing the coverage conducted by some of the most popular news publications in the United States, it was found that news sites were 7 times more likely to publish a story about Columbia instead of City College.

			Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg dropped the charges against 31 of the 42 arrested in Hamilton Hall yet only 9 of the 22 arrested in the Wille Administration building had theirs dismissed. Those arrested in the Wille Administration building faced felony charges while those who occupied Hamilton Hall were charged with misdemeanors. Some City College protesters were also detained over 48 hours without seeing a judge, beyond the legal limit. The focus on Columbia allowed for these inequities to go underreported by major media outlets.
		</p>
		<br><br/>
		<p>
			“A lot of mainstream journalists were coming onto campus with a narrative to fulfill," said Leon Orlov-Sullivan, former Editor-in-Chief of City College’s newspaper who had also live streamed the night on Instagram.
		</p>
		<br><br/>
		<p>
			"It was almost like they already had their articles written by the time that they got there.”
